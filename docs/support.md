# Support & Requests

### There are three kinds of support we offer, please read below on what to do for each.

---

### **There's a bug with the addon or its not working!**
Please follow this line of action if your Addon has a bug or is not working as intended. **Do these in order! Do not skip right to contacting Katie**

1. Ensure the bug is **not** related to your dependencies for that addon. Check the Addon page, if you're missing a dependency or using an unsupported alternative consider the section below ``request support`` to see if Katie will add support for that addon.
2. Check the addon page for your addon and look for a **Common Issues** section, if it has one, ensure your issue is not listed.
3. Ensure you have not touched your Advanced Configuration settings.
4. Contact Katie directly at ``Katie#2191`` whom will give you support 1on1, this support is not provided if you've not followed all steps above.

### **Can you support this addon or library in your addon?!**

-  Go to your addon page and check for a **No Support** section, if there is one, make sure the item you're about to request is not inside of it.
2. Be prepared to supply the addon or library to Katie if she doesn't already have it.
3. Contact ``Katie#2191`` with your request of which addon you want hers to support and why it may be of benefit.
