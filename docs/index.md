# Welcome to SnowKatie's (Snowk) Mods & Addons

## **Message from Katie**

*First of all I'd like to happily thank anyone who has chosen to use my addons â€” I have only just started my journey as a FiveM addon developer and I'm fully dedicated towards developing more addons in the future. Anyone who chooses to support me will have my full unconditional and good-faith support to any of their needs in relation to my addons. I will never abandon an addon unless it is completely finished and bug-free.*

## **Katies Promises**
These are my absolute promises and I will value these completely until I conclude developing on the FiveM platform.

!!! success "No addon will be abandoned"
    Any addon that is not in a finished state **or** currently has bugs that hinder its usage will not be abandoned.

!!! success "I will resolve issues in a timely manner"
    I will do my best to resolve any issues you may have as quickly as possible.

!!! success "I will always strive to build a solid server-side"
    I have a history of Client to Server communication auditing and understand, more than most the hooking possibilities of bad actors and cheaters, I understand wholely that no client-side communication can be trusted and will strive, in all my scripts where possible, to prevent abuse from lying to Server Events.

!!! success "I will support large library addons or systems"
    As long as I have access and they are reasonablly coded I will make an attempt to support the addon or library you use for your Menus, Games, etc.

!!! success "I will release a minimum of 1 script per month."
    One script per month of good quality will be produced.
