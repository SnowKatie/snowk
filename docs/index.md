# Welcome to Truthy Docs

## **Message from Katie**

First of all, I'd like to **personally** thank you for choosing my modest **Truth or Dare** Discord bot and know it means a lot to me how many people have fun and connect together using what I've created here. With that being said, these are the official documents for the **Truthy** Discord bot, I'll do my best to keep these up to date and relevant.

## **What is Truthy Docs?**

Everything in these documents relates to the ``Truthy, Truth or Dare`` Discord application & bot. We serve all of the commands here with help for each command and also have our important legal documentation such as our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. Please take a look around and read over them!
