## **Configuration Guide**
When configuring any of my addons please note that the advanced configuration will not be supported if you change it, such configurations are built for people with more technical knowledge and if you change this you are presumed to know what you're doing thus you will be given no support.

**Simple Config: ``Required Dependencys``**
=== "framework"

    ``` lua
    simpleConfig.framework = "ESX"
    --[[
      Supported: ESX
      None aka "" is not supported. This configuration is required.
    --]]
    ```

=== "menu"

    ``` lua
    simpleConfig.menu = "qtarget"
    --[[

    ```

    --[[
      These two values are for where your NPC spawns, the first is the location with an X, Y and Z coord. The second

    --]]
    ```

    --[[
      These two values are for where your Vehicle spawns, the first is the location with an X, Y and Z coord. The second
